EXAMPLE INPUT AND OUTPUT
User:
How is the S&P 500 doing?

Assistant:
The S&P 500 has recently experienced significant volatility but also notable gains. It rose by 2.5%, marking its best day since April 9, driven by optimism over easing trade tensions. However, it also saw a 2.2% decline on April 16, marking the 18th time this year it fell by at least 1% in a single session. Historically, such volatility has been followed by strong returns, averaging 28.3% in the following year. The index is currently up more than 2% following positive trade developments, though it remains sensitive to geopolitical changes. [Sources: Bloomberg, Yahoo Finance]
